# sprint_4_project
Cristobal Licea's webapp for sprint 4

Donâ€™t forget to update the README file when you are done. It should contain a basic description of the project, explaining that this is a tool to simulate random events, and the methods and libraries used to implement it. It should also contain instructions on how other people could launch your project on their local machine if they wanted to.

Project Description: The development and deployment of a publically accessible web application that allows users to view car advertisement listings, as well as gain insights into the available options so that they make make the best purchase based on their conditions

Libraries used: Streamlit is used for creating the web app, while Pandas is used for viewing and editing DataFrames, and plotly.express makes visual representations with more compact code than plain plotly.

How to lanuch: Download and open terminal from project, then run "streamlit run app.py" to view the web application. You will be able to view the entire listing, as well as view the prices for individual cars based on model, model year, and condition.
